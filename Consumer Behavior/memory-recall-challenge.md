# Memory Recall Challenge

## Overview
This activity demonstrates how attention and memory shape brand salience.  
Students view a rapid sequence of brand logos, then attempt to recall as many as possible.  
The task reveals how exposure and design influence brand memory.

## Learning Objectives
- Explain how exposure and repetition affect memory encoding.  
- Recognize the role of attention in forming brand recall.  
- Link memory performance to advertising effectiveness.

## Materials
- Slides with 20–25 brand logos (shown for 1 second each)  
- Timer  
- Paper or digital recall sheet  

## Preparation
1. Create a short slide deck of familiar brand logos (mix strong and weak brands).  
2. Randomize order and avoid text cues.  
3. Prepare recall forms for students.

## Procedure
### Step 1 – Exposure (0–10 min)
Show each logo quickly with no commentary.

### Step 2 – Distraction (10–15 min)
Give a short unrelated task (e.g., simple quiz) to simulate natural forgetting.

### Step 3 – Recall (15–25 min)
Students list as many brands as they can remember.

### Step 4 – Discussion (25–40 min)
Tally results and discuss:
- Which brands were most remembered?  
- What made them easier to recall (color, simplicity, familiarity)?  
- How does this relate to brand salience?

## Reflection
“What features make certain brands more memorable than others?”
