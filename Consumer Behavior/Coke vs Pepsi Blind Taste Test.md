## Overview

The Coke vs Pepsi Blind Taste Test demonstrates how perception and branding influence sensory judgment.  
Students compare two cola brands without knowing which is which, then analyze whether their taste preference matches their prior brand attitude.  
This activity highlights how brand cues, expectations, and schemas shape consumer experience.

## Preparation

### Before Class
1. Purchase equal quantities of Coca-Cola and Pepsi (2L bottles are sufficient for up to 60 students).
2. Label bottles as **Sample A** and **Sample B** — do not reveal which is which.
3. Chill both drinks to the same temperature.
4. Prepare two cups per student, labeled A and B underneath.
5. Provide water cups for palate cleansing.
6. Print or share the **Student Recording Sheet** (see below).
7. Keep a private note of which brand is A and which is B.

### In-Class Setup
- Place both cola samples on a table, away from view.
- Pour equal volumes of each cola into labelled cups.
- Ensure no branding cues (bottles, caps, labels) are visible.

## Procedure

### Step 1 – Introduction (0–10 minutes)
- Explain that the goal is to test whether sensory preference matches brand attitude.  
- Ask for a quick show of hands:
  - Who prefers Coke?
  - Who prefers Pepsi?
  - Who has no preference?
- Explain that the taste test will be blind and that everyone will record their results individually.

---

### Step 2 – Taste Test (10–30 minutes)
1. Distribute two cups (A and B) to each student.  
   Half the groups start with A, half with B (to avoid order bias).
2. Ask students to:
   - Taste both samples.
   - Choose which one they prefer.
   - Rate their **confidence** (1–5).
   - Guess which brand each sample is.
   - Indicate their **pre-existing favorite** brand.
3. Collect responses via paper forms or Google Forms.

---

### Step 3 – Reveal and Discussion (30–45 minutes)
1. Reveal which sample corresponds to which brand.
2. Tally the results live and display:
   - % preferring Coke
   - % preferring Pepsi
   - % guessing correctly
   - % whose preference changed
3. Discuss:
   - Did sensory preference align with brand attitude?
   - Were participants surprised by the results?
   - How does this show perception bias or brand schema effects?

---

### Step 4 – Debrief and Theory Connection (45–60 minutes)
- Summarize findings:
  - Branding shapes experience beyond sensory input.
  - Perception is filtered through expectation and prior belief.
- Connect to theory:
  - **Keller’s Brand Equity Model**
  - **Perceptual bias and schema activation**
  - **Kahneman’s System 1 and System 2 thinking**
- Assign reflection:
  - “Describe how this activity demonstrates the relationship between perception and brand knowledge.”

## Instructor Summary Table

| Sample | Actual Brand | % of Students Preferring | % Correctly Guessed | Mean Confidence | Observations |
|---------|---------------|--------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| A | Coke |  |  |  |  |
| B | Pepsi |  |  |  |  |

*Use Excel or Google Sheets to calculate percentages and averages (e.g., `=COUNTIF(B2:B31,"A")/COUNTA(B2:B31)`).*

## Assessment Ideas
- **Reflection (150–200 words)**  
  “Explain how your experience in the taste test illustrates the role of brand cues in shaping consumer perception.”
- **Short quiz question**  
  “Define perception bias and describe one example from this activity.”

---

## Variations
1. **Branded Round** – Repeat the test with brand labels visible to observe expectation effects.  
2. **Cultural Comparison** – Use local vs. global cola brands.  
3. **Experimental Extension** – Split the class into two groups (blind vs. branded) and analyze statistically.

## Instructor Notes
- Keep the test ethical and safe: disclose caffeine and sugar content.  
- Focus debrief on **why** perception and expectation can outweigh sensory experience.  
- This activity works well early in a Consumer Behavior or Branding module.
