# Implicit Association Task (DIY)

## Overview
Students complete a simple Implicit Association Task (IAT) to uncover unconscious biases toward competing brands.  
The activity links automatic associations and brand stereotypes to consumer behavior.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand implicit vs. explicit attitudes.  
- Recognize how automatic associations shape brand preference.  
- Interpret IAT results and connect them to marketing implications.

## Materials
- Laptop or smartphone with internet access  
- Free IAT tool (e.g., Project Implicit or open-source version)  
- Worksheet for recording reaction times and bias direction  

## Preparation
1. Introduce implicit and explicit attitudes.  
2. Provide access to a brand-related IAT (e.g., Apple vs Samsung or Coke vs Pepsi).  
3. Explain that faster reaction times indicate stronger associations.

## Procedure
### Step 1 – Introduction (0–10 min)
Explain how IAT measures subconscious associations using reaction times.

### Step 2 – Test (10–25 min)
Students complete the IAT and record their reaction time data or automatic bias direction.

### Step 3 – Discussion (25–45 min)
Compare implicit results with self-reported brand preferences.  
Discuss discrepancies between conscious attitudes and subconscious reactions.

### Step 4 – Debrief (45–60 min)
Connect findings to marketing strategy:
- How can brands leverage or mitigate implicit bias?  
- What ethical issues arise when using subconscious persuasion?

## Reflection
“How do implicit attitudes differ from what consumers consciously report? What does this mean for brand strategy?”
