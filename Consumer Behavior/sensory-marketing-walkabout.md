# Sensory Marketing Walkabout

## Overview
Students explore real or virtual retail and service environments to observe how brands use sensory cues—sight, sound, smell, touch, and layout—to shape perception and brand experience.  
The goal is to connect environmental design with consumer psychology and brand meaning.

## Learning Objectives
- Identify how sensory elements (lighting, scent, music, texture) affect perception and emotion.  
- Evaluate how multisensory design communicates brand positioning.  
- Apply sensory marketing and atmospherics frameworks to real-world contexts.

## Materials
- Observation worksheet or notebook  
- Pen or tablet  
- Optional: smartphone camera for documentation  

## Preparation
1. Choose 2–3 nearby stores, cafés, or service spaces (on-site or virtual).  
2. Brief students on sensory marketing and the five sensory dimensions: visual, auditory, olfactory, tactile, and spatial.  
3. Provide observation prompts or a table (e.g., “dominant sense,” “brand message,” “emotional tone”).  

## Procedure
### Step 1 – Introduction (0–10 min)
Explain sensory marketing concepts and show one or two examples of sensory branding.

### Step 2 – Observation (10–35 min)
Students visit or view the chosen environments and record:
- Which sensory cues stand out  
- What emotions or associations they trigger  
- Whether the cues fit the brand’s message  

### Step 3 – Debrief (35–60 min)
Groups share findings. Discuss common design themes and their impact on brand experience.

## Reflection
“How does sensory design influence perceived quality and emotion? Which sense had the strongest effect?”
