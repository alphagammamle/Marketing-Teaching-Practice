# Product Design Value Lab

## Overview
Students analyze and redesign a simple product to explore how **design choices communicate value**.  
The activity focuses on how form, function, and symbolism combine to influence perceived quality, usability, and emotional appeal.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how design communicates both functional and emotional value.  
- Identify cues that signal quality, innovation, or brand meaning.  
- Redesign an everyday product to enhance its perceived value.  

## Materials
- Everyday products (pens, mugs, bottles, notebooks, packaging, etc.)  
- Paper, markers, sticky notes, or digital design tools  
- Observation worksheet or redesign brief  

## Preparation
1. Select 3–5 examples of low-cost, everyday products.  
2. Prepare a short introduction on the **three layers of value**: functional, aesthetic, and symbolic.  
3. Provide each group with one product to critique and redesign.

## Procedure
### Step 1 – Introduction (0–10 min)
Explain the idea that **product design creates value beyond function**.  
Show a few examples of premium vs. budget versions of similar products.

### Step 2 – Evaluation (10–25 min)
Groups examine their assigned product and discuss:
- What is the core function?  
- What design features create or limit perceived quality?  
- What emotions or meanings does the product convey?  

### Step 3 – Redesign (25–45 min)
Students sketch a redesign that increases one or more types of value:
- **Functional value** – improve usability or ergonomics  
- **Aesthetic value** – enhance form, color, or material  
- **Symbolic value** – express identity or lifestyle meaning  

### Step 4 – Presentation (45–60 min)
Groups present their redesigns and justify how their choices communicate value.

## Reflection
“How does product design create meaning beyond utility? Which design changes most improved perceived value?”
