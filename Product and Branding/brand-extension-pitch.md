# Brand Extension Pitch

## Overview
Students create and pitch a **new product or service extension** for an existing brand.  
The exercise develops strategic thinking about **brand fit, consistency, and innovation**.

## Learning Objectives
- Evaluate how a new product can align with an existing brand identity.  
- Balance brand consistency with novelty and market opportunity.  
- Develop persuasive reasoning for brand extension decisions.

## Materials
- Presentation slides or poster template  
- Access to brand information and target audience data  
- Worksheet outlining brand fit dimensions (category fit, image fit, relevance)

## Preparation
1. Assign each team a well-known brand.  
2. Review **Keller’s Brand Equity Model** and **Aaker’s Brand Extension Guidelines**.  
3. Provide examples of successful and failed extensions (e.g., Apple Watch vs. Colgate Frozen Meals).

## Procedure
### Step 1 – Brainstorm (0–15 min)
Teams brainstorm potential new products or services that could logically extend their brand.

### Step 2 – Develop (15–40 min)
Each team creates:
- A short product concept  
- Target market and value proposition  
- Justification for brand fit  

### Step 3 – Pitch (40–60 min)
Teams present their extension idea in 2–3 minutes.  
Classmates and instructor provide feedback on brand coherence and creativity.

## Debrief
Discuss which ideas felt most authentic to the brand and why others seemed inconsistent or forced.  
Highlight the trade-off between **brand leverage** and **brand dilution**.

## Reflection
“What makes a brand extension credible and valuable? How does fit influence acceptance?”
