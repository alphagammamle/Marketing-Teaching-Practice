# Packaging and Perception Experiment

## Overview
This exercise explores how **visual design and packaging** influence perceived quality and brand preference.  
Students compare different package designs and analyze how small visual cues change consumer judgments.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how design cues (color, typography, material, shape) affect brand perception.  
- Identify visual signals that create impressions of quality or sustainability.  
- Apply perception and semiotics theory to packaging design.

## Materials
- 4–6 contrasting packages of the same product category (e.g., snacks, bottled water)  
- Rating sheets or online survey form  
- Projector or visual examples of packaging redesigns  

## Preparation
1. Collect packaging examples that differ in price positioning and style.  
2. Prepare a short introduction on **visual semiotics** and **perception cues** (color, font, shape, material).  
3. Prepare a rating form with scales such as:
   - Attractiveness (1–5)  
   - Perceived quality (1–5)  
   - Environmental friendliness (1–5)  
   - Likelihood to buy (1–5)

## Procedure
### Step 1 – Introduction (0–10 min)
Explain that packaging acts as a “silent salesperson” conveying brand meaning at a glance.

### Step 2 – Evaluation (10–30 min)
Students rate each package independently using the prepared scale.

### Step 3 – Discussion (30–50 min)
Compare group results:
- Which design elements most strongly affected perception?  
- Were “premium” cues consistent across brands?  
- How do sustainability cues influence purchase intent?

### Step 4 – Redesign (50–60 min)
Optionally, have groups sketch a packaging redesign to better communicate brand values.

## Reflection
“What design elements most strongly influenced your perception of quality or sustainability? How can brands use these cues ethically?”
